This is a list to record my feelings and emotions after repeatedly watching Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley.

1st watch -- This is a catchier song than I remember, I haven't listened to it in years it feels like. This dude has some hip action. 
I found myself bobbing my head and tapping my foot along to the beat. I forgot there were more words other than the chorus.
Dude in the white shirt and jeans got some MOVES. Woah, that backflip doe. Ah, the classic 15 second fade at the end.

2nd watch -- Didn't notice the nice wrist action this dude has in the beginning. He's rocking that tan cloak. I think
we have one of those lying around here somewhere. Who knows when you'll need to cosplay as Inspector Gadget, right?
Why does everyone have their shirt tucked into their pants? They on their way to a job interview or a wedding?
Why is Rick performing in an empty ballroom? Who are these dancers? Are they being paid?

3rd watch -- So far this isn't as terrible as I initially thought it would be. It's an old song used in stale memes,
but it was popular for a reason I guess. Nice beat. Not modern by any means, but forever will be held dear to many.
It really comforts me that Rick will always be there for me. This video goes to show that you don't really need to have
any dancing skills to be famous. I guess as long as your rich enough to hire people to dance for you instead, then it works.
I'd like to see the footage 5 seconds after that dude jumps into that fence, THAT'S the content I'm looking for here.
