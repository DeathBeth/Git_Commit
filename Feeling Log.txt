This is a list to record my feelings and emotions after repeatedly watching Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley.

1st watch -- This is a catchier song than I remember, I haven't listened to it in years it feels like. This dude has some hip action. 
I found myself bobbing my head and tapping my foot along to the beat. I forgot there were more words other than the chorus.
Dude in the white shirt and jeans got some MOVES. Woah, that backflip doe. Ah, the classic 15 second fade at the end.

2nd watch -- Didn't notice the nice wrist action this dude has in the beginning. He's rocking that tan cloak. I think
we have one of those lying around here somewhere. Who knows when you'll need to cosplay as Inspector Gadget, right?
Why does everyone have their shirt tucked into their pants? They on their way to a job interview or a wedding?
Why is Rick performing in an empty ballroom? Who are these dancers? Are they being paid?

3rd watch -- So far this isn't as terrible as I initially thought it would be. It's an old song used in stale memes,
but it was popular for a reason I guess. Nice beat. Not modern by any means, but forever will be held dear to many.
It really comforts me that Rick will always be there for me. This video goes to show that you don't really need to have
any dancing skills to be famous. I guess as long as your rich enough to hire people to dance for you instead, then it works.
I'd like to see the footage 5 seconds after that dude jumps into that fence, THAT'S the content I'm looking for here.

4th watch -- Okay those first notes actually kinda startled me. My finger clicked the play button before I was mentally
prepared #millenialprobs. I didn't know of this song until the memes came around, so was this song popular before the internet
blew it up, or was it this popular BECAUSE someone decided it would be funny? These are the questions that keep me up at night.
That one 2 second shot of him just smiling is nice and adds character to the video. I did the same thing when I was editing videos
in Jr High. I think my brain is starting to mentally check out, because the video is over before I realize it... well, I can tell it's
over before it finishes because of that 15 sec fade, but you know what I mean.

5th watch -- That's a really old style of microphone. At least, I think? These sweeping shots are starting to make me dizzy. Why do the
dancers have so much choreography if the editor is gonna cut away from them so often? Most of the time they're shown just flipping their head
around to look at the camera. That's not dancing, that's spinning. Man, quality for music videos had a really low bar back then. How did they get 
that lighting effect on the walls? Looks like light being shown through agitated water. Holy crap, is it really over already? Am I blacking out?

6th watch -- I still don't understand half of what this guy is singing. Are they recording this at a church? Why does this church have a bar?
I wont judge. I like to imagine that they fenced off the road beneath that bridge looking structure, and people driving by are seeing this redhead
randomly flinging his arms about while he mouthes along to this song. I bet $10 they were playing this song on a crappy radio. I wanna see this video
with the raw noise. I wonder how the bloopers look. Can you mess up swaying?

7th watch -- I think I'm starting to die inside a little. Just a little. I have hope in my heart that I'll make it through this. That's the nature of the
human spirit, being able to push through the tough times because we know the reward will be worth it. Weird being told that my heart has been aching, considering
I lack one. I want to see more of this bartender, he's really getting into it. Did the fog machine take up most of the budget? Maybe they saved some money by burning
a pile of stuff behind them. It really looks like something is on fire here. 

8th watch -- The most painful thing is that Haley is just listening through her Pandora station for her assignment, so I'll get bits of better songs in between listens. 
I have to force myself to hit play, and that jarring first note gets me. "Never gonna make you cry" sorry Rick, you may just do that today... 
Why DOES that guy just jump into that fence? Why is it so springy? If the fence is that loose, I don't think slamming your body into it is going to aid it's stuctural 
integrity in any way. I think you can get fined for that.
