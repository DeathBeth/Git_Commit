This is a list to record my feelings and emotions after repeatedly watching Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley.

1st watch -- This is a catchier song than I remember, I haven't listened to it in years it feels like. This dude has some hip action. 
I found myself bobbing my head and tapping my foot along to the beat. I forgot there were more words other than the chorus.
Dude in the white shirt and jeans got some MOVES. Woah, that backflip doe. Ah, the classic 15 second fade at the end.

2nd watch -- Didn't notice the nice wrist action this dude has in the beginning. He's rocking that tan cloak. I think
we have one of those lying around here somewhere. Who knows when you'll need to cosplay as Inspector Gadget, right?
Why does everyone have their shirt tucked into their pants? They on their way to a job interview or a wedding?
Why is Rick performing in an empty ballroom? Who are these dancers? Are they being paid?
