This is a list to record my feelings and emotions after repeatedly watching Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley.

1st watch -- This is a catchier song than I remember, I haven't listened to it in years it feels like. This dude has some hip action. 
I found myself bobbing my head and tapping my foot along to the beat. I forgot there were more words other than the chorus.
Dude in the white shirt and jeans got some MOVES. Woah, that backflip doe. Ah, the classic 15 second fade at the end.
